# Blockcore Provider

Web3 Provider for Blockcore.

The provider is how web3 talks to the blockchains. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally done by submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket based server.

The provider also allows connection to be made between web site / web app and the Blockcore Extension.
